# Content-Watcher - Still a Work in Progress!

Have you ever refreshed a page several times a day to check for updates (for example, checking a for-sale page for a particular item, 
a news site for a particular event, or a subreddit for a specific keyword)? What you need is a content watcher! With this program a user 
will be able to enter a URL, a specific search term/topic, and choose a time frequency that'll update you on results of that particular topic
you're searching for!

Our content-water runs on 4 main components (scraper, scheduler, query entry & notifier) that all run together.

<div class="text-red">
In order to run this content watch, you can download this project yourself and run it on your terminal!
Please have python and it's packages for Flask, BeautifulSoup, and Requests also installed in order for the program to properly run.
