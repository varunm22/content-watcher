# Content-Watcher - Still a Work in Progress!

Have you ever refreshed a page several times a day to check for updates (for example, checking a for-sale page for a particular item, 
a news site for a particular event, or a subreddit for a specific keyword)? What you need is a content watcher! With this program a user 
will be able to enter a URL, a specific search term/topic, and choose a time frequency that'll update you on results of that particular topic
you're searching for!

Our content-water runs on 4 main components (scraper, scheduler, query entry & notifier) that all run together.

# Installation Process
In order to run this content watch, you can download this project yourself and run it on your terminal!
Please have Python 3 installed and use pip to install packages for Flask, BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Flask-Jsonpify also installed in order for the program to properly run.
